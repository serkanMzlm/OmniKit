### Build Project

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
make 
make install
```

- Default Behavior: When you run the make command, it displays messages like Entering directory '/path' and Leaving directory '/path' whenever it enters or exits a subdirectory. These messages indicate which directories make is operating in.

- `--no-print-directory` Option: When this option is active, the make command suppresses such messages. This is useful for users who want to see only the important information during the build process.

```bash
make --no-print-directory
#or
make -s
```

When entering the command `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..`, the reason for doing so is to specify the directory where we want to install the file. If not specified, installation will default to the `/usr/local/lib/` directory, requiring root permissions during make install. Otherwise, you'll encounter a **Permission denied** error.
